## Open-source Tools for Training Resources - OTTR

Go to [ottrproject.org](https://www.ottrproject.org/) to get started! :tada:

The purpose of this course template and guide is to make course publishing maintenance across multiple different platforms _less painful_.

_This template and guide helps you_:   

- Edit and write a course in [RMarkdown files](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and have it published to multiple different platforms:
  - [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/bookstore?type=course)
  - [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)
  - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- Have [Github action robots](https://www.ottrproject.org/customize-robots.html) do your repetitive tasks like spell check and re-rendering.
- Use [automagic conversion](https://github.com/jhudsl/ottrpal) to ease the lift of prepping the material for different platforms' formats.
- Use [our Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jhudsl/base_ottr) for consistency across authors as well as to help you [avoid dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

[See the OTTR pre-print here!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07083)
